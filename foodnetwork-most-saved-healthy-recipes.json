      "chef_note": "Recommended Wine: 2001 Pecchenino Origin: Alba, Piedmont Grape: Dolcetto Wine notes: Using white wine for fish and red wine for meat no longer applies. Break with tradition. Italy produces many interesting reds, so for this dish I chose a classic Italian wine made from the dolcetto grape. This lighter bodied red will marry well with my salmon dish which has a rich and silky texture. The delicacy of the herbs in my mustard glaze goes nicely with the fruity nature of the wine. My rule for pairing wine with dishes is to go with what tastes good. Wine Pouring Notes: Do not fill above the curve of the bowl, never more than 1/2 full, that way you can get a true sense of the wine's aroma and a better sense of its bouquet. To get the full experience of the wine, place your nose into the glass and take in the wine's beautiful aroma."

Sprinkle the rub over the tenderloin with a dry hand, then rub the pork with the seasoning over both sides of the meat, pressing gently so the seasoning adheres well to the tenderloin.            ",
