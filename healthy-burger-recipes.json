Place 1 chilled patty in the beaten egg, turning over the patty to coat the other side. Dip the patty in the cornmeal-breadcrumb mixture and sprinkle the mixture over the top of the patty, lightly pressing it on. Repeat with the remaining 3 patties.            ",
        "              Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add half of the canola oil and the patties and cook until they are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining oil to the skillet and use a spatula to carefully flip the patties (they will be somewhat soft); cook the other side until golden brown, 3 to 4 more minutes. Serve each burger on a bun with your favorite toppings.            "
