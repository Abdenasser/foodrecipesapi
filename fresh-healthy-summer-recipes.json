Place between two sheets of plastic wrap or waxed paper. Use a meat pounder or the bottom of a small, heavy skillet to pound to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. You also can save yourself time by asking your butcher to do it for you."

Place the salmon fillets on a cutting board, skin-side down. Cut down the center of each fillet lengthwise along the center seam. Cut through the flesh but not the skin. Draw the salmon flesh apart at the incision, flattening the fillets, leaving them skin-side down.

Rotate each fillet one quarter-turn (90 degrees) and grill just long enough to mark the fillets, completing a cross-hatch pattern, less than 1 minute. Turn the fillets over and repeat the grilling and rotating procedure until the other sides show the cross-hatch grill markings. Remove the fish from the grill and reserve. (The salmon can be grilled up to 1 hour in advance of the meal.)             ",

Transfer the crushed cucumbers to a cutting board, and then coarsely chop. Combine the cucumbers, sliced fennel, dates, walnuts, chives and some of the fennel fronds in a salad bowl and mix gently.             ",
        "              Finish cooking the salmon and dress the salad: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the salmon fillets in a baking dish, brush each one lightly with extra-virgin olive oil and roast about 3 1/2 minutes for medium-rare.             ",

Drizzle a little fruity olive oil on top of each portion, garnish each plate with fennel fronds and serve.            "

        "              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously coat a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Spread the walnuts out on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly golden, about 7 minutes. Cool and roughly chop. Coarsely grate the zucchini into a bowl and squeeze out the excess liquid; you should have about 1 1/2 cups zucchini. Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the sugar, oil, apple butter, vanilla and eggs with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until just combined, and then on medium speed for 30 seconds. Stir in the zucchini and nuts until evenly combined. Pour the batter into the loaf pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Remove the bread from the pan and completely cool. Cut into 24 slices and serve at room temperature.            "

Moving them frequently will help you avoid scorching them on the hotter parts of the grill before they cook all the way through. If you're using a grill pan, you'll want to cook the slices in 2 batches to avoid crowding the pan."
